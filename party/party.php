			<p><img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" style="float:left; margin:0 10px 0 0;" width="150px" src="<?php echo BASE_URL; ?>img/chantelle.jpg">I met you in grade Primary. We&#8217;ve been friends for so long that I rely on your memory to remember my own past. My greatest memories with you are our choreographed dance routines and our taped over cassette recording sessions. I&#8217;ve often wondered how much easier life would be if you and I were just neighbors. I hope we&#8217;re friends until we die then I hope we stay ghost friends.</p>

So I suppose I met you at birth. I don&#8217;t remember it, but it&#8217;s safe to say we were introduced at around that time. Nonetheless, my earliest memories of you include: you waking me up in bed by playing &quot;steam roller&quot; (a game consisting of rolling on top of me and yelling &quot;steam roller!&quot;); playing games of hide-and-seek with your various friends on Regal Road; and witnessing you beat &quot;Chaos&quot; in Final Fantasy 1 on that big wooden tube television (that was awesome).</p>

We share the same wavelength, from enjoying live music to a good glass of wine. When we have plans to hang out, it gives me something to look forward to all week. I know your wardrobe inside and out. I know that we can tell each other anything, and know we won&#8217;t be judged.</p>

You know every one of my quirks, so I&#8217;m never afraid to be myself around you. One of my favorite memories with you was getting lost in PEI in the middle of the night and hitch hiking back to our campsite. Whenever I have a stressful day, you&#8217;re the person I want to talk to, which, I know, sucks for you, but you deal with it like a champ, and I appreciate that.</p>

Awkward family gatherings are way more fun when you can hide out with your cousin, or just sit and laugh at all of your crazy family members. We have ceaseless mentions of inside jokes and old memories of our stays at the camp. We&#8217;re more than just friends. We&#8217;re blood. </p>

You were my first best friend and all my best memories involve you. Some of which include our snake training, our adventures through the woods, our lights-out pillow fights and all of the movies we spent watching in your cozy room. I love how we can always pick up right where we left off and know we&#8217;re always going to be the same. I can (and do) tell you everything. You know exactly how weird I am and still love me.</p>

Again, I most likely met you pretty close after I was born but I honestly can&#8217;t remember it. Sorry. My earliest memories of you include: watching Star Wars in your bedroom in the basement of our Regal Road house, beating up Chris and Dereck when they were picking on me, and having sleep overs at your apartment when you moved out.</p>

This joke is getting old but I can&#8217;t remember when we first met, but I&#8217;m sure it was shortly after my birth. However, my earliest memories of you include: teaching our dog Champ some pretty cool tricks (remember that one where you got her to army crawl towards a treat?), watching you and your friend Rene play Sega Genesis all weekend, and playing basketball in the driveway.</p>

However, you might as well be my blood brother because I honestly can&#8217;t remember much before you and my sister Nicole were together. You&#8217;ve been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. My earliest memories of you include: your funny looking car (was it a Chevy Chevette?), you proposing to my sister during Christmas, oh and that time you had to babysit me and something happened that I&#8217;m sure will come up at some point during the reception so I won&#8217;t mention it here.</p>

That was my first year at Halifax Grammar School and I was a week late for my first day because of an illness. We probably would have become friends regardless, but it was amazingly serendipitous that, when Mr. Laffoley introduced me to our class, he tasked you with breaking me in and making sure I got along all right. Maybe he knew, or maybe it was random, but I think we owe him thanks for helping start an awesome friendship.</p>
