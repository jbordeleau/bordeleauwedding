			<p>Carissa and Jeremy met at Saint Mary's University in 2008. Carissa pretended that she needed help in class and asked Jeremy to be a tutor since he was obviously the smartest(cutest) one. Of course, Jeremy agreed immediately. However, he noticed during their first (and only) tutor session that Carissa didn't need any help and she confessed that she just wanted to meet Jeremy. The rest is history.</p>
